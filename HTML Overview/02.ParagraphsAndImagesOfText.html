		<h3>Hyperloop</h3>
		<p>
			On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a proposal for a new form of transportation between the Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area, after being disappointed with the
			 approved California High-Speed Rail system. He named it "hyperloop," a hypothetical subsonic air travel machine that stretches approximately 350 miles (560 km) from Sylmar 
			 (a northern district of Los Angeles) to Hayward (east of San Francisco) and would theoretically allow commuters to travel between the cities in 30 minutes or less, providing a shorter
			  traveling time than even a commercial airplane can currently provide.[64] Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make travel cheaper than any
			   other mode of transport for such long distances. The system is proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high speed travel
			    with relatively low power. He has estimated the total cost of the system at $6 billion, but this amount is speculative.[65] It was proposed to rely completely on solar energy for
			     all power requirements.
